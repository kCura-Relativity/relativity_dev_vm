Develop application event handlers
You can develop event handlers that facilitate common tasks performed when installing and uninstalling applications. You can use application event handlers to execute tasks that facilitate the installation of your custom application. For example, they can facilitate creating workspaces and database tables, or setting default values on objects. They can also perform cleanup activities when you delete a workspace or uninstall an application. These event handlers execute at the application level rather than on specific object types. For more information, see Develop object type event handlers.
